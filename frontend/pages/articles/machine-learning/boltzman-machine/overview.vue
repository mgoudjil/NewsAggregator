        Humans don’t start their thinking from scratch every second. As you read
        this essay, you understand each word based on your understanding of
        previous words. You don’t throw everything away and start thinking from
        scratch again. Your thoughts have persistence. Traditional neural
        networks can’t do this, and it seems like a major shortcoming. For
        example, imagine you want to classify what kind of event is happening at
        every point in a movie. It’s unclear how a traditional neural network
        could use its reasoning about previous events in the film to inform
        later ones.
